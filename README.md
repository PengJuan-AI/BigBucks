## Description
BigBucks is a trading simulation platform that allows users to trade all kinds of assets in real-time or historically. BigBucks also provides comprehensive analysis for users' portfolios including the efficient frontier and pretty and concise charts.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.
